# examprep-clfc01

This repository offers a collection of exam preparation services and notes for students taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01).

# Contribution

Feel free to contribute to existing services or add new ones. Please follow the guidelines when submitting, you can find them in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and especially the rules about how to select a exam prep service and describe it.

The goal is to have enough details about each exam prep service so students can choose whether or not the service suits their needs just by reading the description.

Please also have a look to the [List of excluded services](pages/excluded-services.md) where you can find which service has been considered and why it has been rejected.

# Audience Profile

The target candidate should have 6 months, or equivalent, of active engagement with the AWS Cloud, with exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and/or operations. Candidates will demonstrate an understanding of well-designed AWS Cloud solutions.

# Skills Measured

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) exam is intended for individuals who can effectively demonstrate an overall knowledge of the AWS Cloud independent of a specific job role.

The exam validates a candidate's ability to complete the following tasks:

* Explain the value of the AWS Cloud
* Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model
* Understand security best practices
* Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices
* Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, databases, and storage
* Identify AWS services for common use cases

# Exam Content

## Response types

There are two types of questions on the exam:

* **Multiple choice**: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
* **Multiple response**: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect, there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 questions that will affect your score.

## Unscored content

The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about candidate performance on these unscored questions to evalute these questions for future use as scored questions.

The unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

## Exam results.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100-1,000. The minimum passing score is 700.

The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each candidate is allowed a maximum of three exam attempts within a one year time period.
